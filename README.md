## Overview
One of the most intriguing mysteries for humankind is simply "Are we alone?" Are we the only sentient beings in the universe or are there others out there? For years, humanity has seen strange lights, peculiar objects, or other unexplainable phenomena in the sky and recorded these sightings. This webpage will serve as a excellent source for searching for these sightings based off of several different critera (i.e. City the sighting took place in, Date it occured, etc)

Expanding this would make it much more useful for finding trends and commonality in these mysterious sightings. 

Also, the search functionality could be expanded. For instance: It would be beneficial to be able to search by sighting duration. From here you could see if UFO sightings were more common in certain areas over time (especially with an expanded data set). Adding the capability of searching for keywords from the Comments section of the table would also be useful, as there is more detail located here such as the color of lights and number.
